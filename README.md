From the basics of file-system operations to multi-threading and distributed computing

The program `main.jl` covers the following topics:
- Basic code execution methods, using help and the package manager;
- File system operations;
- Variables, types, and constants;
- Basic operations on scalars;
- Strings;
- Functions;
- Control flow;
- Arrays;
- Ranges and tuples;
- Functions on arrays, broadcasting;
- Multi-threading;
- Distributed computing;
- Some performance tips.

The program `functions.jl` is called from `main.jl` and is present only to demonstrate code inclusion from external files.
